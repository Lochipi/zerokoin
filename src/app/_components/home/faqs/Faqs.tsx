                  Zerokoin simplifies the process of buying or selling crypto
                  using M-Pesa by intergrating with M-Pesa, Binance, and web
                  wallets APIs to offer automated swaps.

                  At the moment, Zerokoin primarily supports stablecoins for
                  trading. However, we&apos;re continuously exploring
                  opportunities to expand our offerings to include a broader
                  range of tokens in the future. Stay tuned for updates as we
                  work towards enhancing our platform to accommodate additional
                  cryptocurrencies for your trading needs.

                <Accordion.Panel>
                  No, Zerokoin is committed to transparency when it comes to
                  fees. We offer competitive rates closely aligned with the
                  current USD/KES exchange rate, ensuring that users have full
                  visibility into the costs of their transactions. There are no
                  hidden fees â€“ what you see is what you get.

                <Accordion.Panel>
                  For users using our Binance intergration, KYC (Know Your
                  Customer) requirements are handled by Binance and M-Pesa,
                  meaning there&apos;s no need for additional KYC when using
                  Zerokoin. However, for users with self-custodial wallets,
                  minimal KYC is required to ensure compliance with regulatory
                  standards and enhance security measures. Rest assured,
                  Zerokoin aims to keep the KYC process as streamlined and
                  user-friendly as possible while prioritizing the safety and
                  security of all transactions.
