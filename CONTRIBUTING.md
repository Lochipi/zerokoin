# Contributing to Zerokoin

Thank you for considering contributing to Zerokoin! We value your input and strive to make this project a success together. Please follow these guidelines to help maintain the quality and consistency of the project.

## Code Standards

- **Use TypeScript**: All code contributions should be written in TypeScript. Adhere to the rules and best practices of TypeScript to ensure type safety and clarity.
- **Write Standard Code**: Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-structured. Avoid introducing unused code or leaving commented-out code in your submissions.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, files, and branches. Stick to a consistent naming convention (e.g., `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for components, `kebab-case` for file names).

## Commit Messages

- **Write Meaningful Commits**: Your commit messages should clearly describe the changes you've made. Use the following format:
  - `feat: A short description of the feature added`
  - `fix: A short description of the bug fixed`
  - `chore: A short description of maintenance tasks`
  - `docs: A short description of documentation changes`

## Branching

- **Branch Naming**: Follow a consistent branch naming convention. For example:
  - `feature/short-description`
  - `bugfix/short-description`
  - `chore/short-description`
- **Keep Branches Up-to-Date**: Regularly sync your branch with the `main` branch to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth integration.

## Building the Project

- **Run `npm run build` Before Pushing**: Before you push your branch, make sure to run the build command to ensure there are no build errors:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

## Pull Requests

**Open a Pull Request:** When you're ready to submit your changes, open a pull request against the main branch. Include a description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers.
**Review Process:** Your pull request will be reviewed by a team member. Be prepared to make revisions based on feedback.
