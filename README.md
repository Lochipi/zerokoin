# Zerokoin✨

Many Africans are resourceful and eager to seize global opportunities, like those offered by the gig economy. However, high transaction fees, unfavorable exchange rates, and scams often prevent them from fully participating.

Welcome to Zerokoin, a project aimed at simplifying blockchain technology for the average African. Our goal is to empower users to transact seamlessly and effortlessly.

## Introduction

Technology promises many benefits, but not everyone enjoys them equally. Cryptocurrency offers significant advantages, yet its complexity can be a barrier for those without a tech background.

Zerokoin is here to change that by making blockchain technology accessible to everyone, especially in Africa. We believe that even individuals in remote villages should be able to benefit from cryptocurrency. Zerokoin simplifies the technical aspects of blockchain, allowing anyone to get involved without needing an in-depth understanding.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where Africans can transact without barriers, complexity, or high fees. Zerokoin is dedicated to making blockchain accessible and straightforward, enabling seamless transactions through local currency integration and advanced features like MPC wallets and gasless transactions.

### Our Mission

### Key Features
